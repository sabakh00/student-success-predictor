# student-success-predictor

This is a Java-based mini app that simulates predicting student academic risk based on GPA and attendance — inspired by the work of SAS EVAAS.

## Tech Stack

- Java 8
- Maven (build tool)
- JUnit (testing)
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipeline)

## What It Does

- Takes a list of student records
- Flags students who are at risk (GPA < 2.5 and attendance < 75%)
- Runs automated tests on logic
- Uses GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on every push

## Why I Built It

This project was built to explore technologies listed in the SAS Software Developer Internship — including Java, Maven, testing, and CI/CD — while staying aligned with EVAAS's mission to support educators through predictive analytics.

## Sample Output
Amina: At Risk
Ben: Not At Risk
Chris: At Risk
